## Fake Generic Pocketable Monster RPG Conflict Resolution System

_Fake Generic Pocketable Monster RPG Conflict Resolution System_ was an exercise incorporating all aspects of programming covered in the class, including but not limited to: either user interaction or external data, classes, iteration, and appropriately named variables. For this exercise I implemented a prototype monster conflict resolution system based loosely on concepts from [Pok√©mon](https://www.pokemon.com/) and the [Versu](https://versu.com/) interactive storytelling platform using [Tracery](https://tracery.io/); a monster appears, the user selects a representative monster, then the user selects actions for their monster to take to attempt to resolve a conflict with the other monster.

### Concepts Included
- Interaction: The user interacts via mouse presses of instanced buttons.
- External Data: Conflict script and character attributes are loaded from JSON files.
- Classes: Uses modification of pre-existing button class and new character class.
- Iteration: Demonstrates three different JavaScript for-loop syntaxes.
- Appropriately named variables: I hope so!

### Outstanding Issues/Bugs

As is, I am unaware of any immediate "bugs," but am very aware of conceptual shortcomings in this rudimentary prototype that could be expanded in the future.

- Conflict script in sampleTextData.json ends up being very repetitive in the current implementation; in the future, I think it would be better to expand usage of Tracery to allow for further variance of character-specific actions and break more descriptive actions into the separate character files.

- Available character actions should be more dependent on the specific character and reactions to previous actions taken.

- For the scope of this prototype only two Character properties were implemented: introversion and energy. This is a deeply flawed system that should definitely be reconsidered and expanded.

- From a design/experience standpoint, UI feedback is almost nonexistent and would need to be implemented/expanded.
